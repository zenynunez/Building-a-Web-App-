### Tuts+ Course: Building a Web App From Scratch With AngularJS
**Instructor: Andrew Burgess**

AngularJS is an amazing front-end framework that has a very novel approach to building web applications, completely unlike any of the other frameworks you might be used to. In this course, we'll take a look at all the core components of Angular, and how they work together to build a complete application. We'll be building an address book: Starting from nothing at all, and ending up with a complete, working project. The focus of the course will be on Angular, but we'll use Express for the back-end code.



#### Installation

It is assumed that you have already installed node and bower. There are a couple of other compontents that you will need to install.

You should have a global `.bowerrc` file. Create it if it does not exist, with the following contents.

		{
	    	"directory": "public/lib"
		}

Now open your project folder in the commandline and run the following.

		npm install express
		bower install angular
		bower install bootstrap
